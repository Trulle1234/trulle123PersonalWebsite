            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>
                I am a 14 year old from Sweden who likes programing, photogrphy and filmmaking. 
                I am a pretty active member of Hack Club. Right now I am working on learning web 
                development (this website is one of my learning projects).
            </h3>
            <p>
                My interst in programing started at a young age when my dad intereduced me to Scratch.
                After a while I started thinking that Scratch was to easy so i decide that I wanted to learn somthing new
                and i decided on Python. Using a cours by "Unga Programerare" I learned the basics and later Pygame zero.
                I was stuck on that level for a while and just jumping around trying to learn new stuff. But then, about 2 months ago
                a hackathon by Hack Club (Shipwreked) gave me the motivation I needed and now I am making this as my last
                project to get my invite.
